I'm a Full-Stack Developer, highly Back-End Side. I'm interested in almost everything about computer science especially OS, computer networks, distrubuted systems and system design. The languages I use daily are PHP, GO, Nodejs and Javascript. I enjoy working on complex problems, solving those problems is priceless for me!
